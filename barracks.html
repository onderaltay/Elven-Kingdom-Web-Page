        <h1 class="text-center mt-3">Elven Barracks</h1>
        <p class="mt-5 border-bottom border-secondary pb-3 text-light" style="text-indent: 1em;">The Elven Barracks are
            unlike the grim stone fortresses of men or the crude camps of orcs. They embody discipline and readiness,
            yet remain in harmony with the elegance of elven architecture. Built from smooth stone and enchanted wood,
            their walls are etched with glowing runes of protection. Inside the barracks, one can find training grounds
            surrounded by flowering trees, where archers hone their marksmanship and warriors practice swordplay under
            the watchful gaze of seasoned captains. Armor racks shimmer with polished silver and green, and banners
            bearing moonlit emblems sway gently in the breeze. The barracks are not only places of martial discipline
            but also schools of honor, where young elves are taught that strength must always serve wisdom and harmony.
        </p>
        <h5 class="mt-5 text-light  fw-bold">
            Erathel – Barracks of the Capital
        </h5>
        <p class="mt-5 border-bottom border-secondary pb-3 text-light" style="text-indent: 1em;">
            In Erathel, the City of Wisdom, the barracks stand close to the Great Library and the High Council’s
            chambers. They are more ceremonial than militaristic, for Erathel’s warriors are guardians of knowledge and
            sacred places. The barracks here serve as a home for spellblades, mage-knights trained to weave sword and
            sorcery together. Their duty is not only to defend the city but also to safeguard the ancient tomes and
            relics stored in Erathel’s heart. Unlike in other cities, Erathel’s barracks also house scholars who study
            the philosophy of warfare, seeking to ensure that elven blades are always wielded in defense, never
            conquest.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-5 text-light  fw-bold">
            Levandell – Barracks of the City of Song
        </h5>
        <p class="mt-5 border-bottom border-secondary pb-3 text-light" style="text-indent: 1em;">
            In Levandell, the City of Song and Bloom, the barracks appear less like a fortress and more like an open
            pavilion surrounded by gardens. Training takes place in fields filled with wildflowers, and archery ranges
            are
            designed to mimic natural landscapes — forests, rivers, and open meadows — ensuring that the warriors are
            always
            attuned to the living world around them. Levandell’s warriors are renowned scouts and healers, trained in
            both
            combat and the arts of restoration. Their barracks often echo with music during evenings, as soldiers and
            artists alike share songs, reminding the elves that beauty and battle can coexist.
        </p>
        <h5 class="mt-5 text-light  fw-bold">
            Arethon – Barracks of the Sentinel City
        </h5>
        <p class="mt-5 border-bottom border-secondary pb-3 text-light" style="text-indent: 1em;">
            In Arethon, the northern sentinel of the kingdom, the barracks are formidable and imposing, carved into the
            cliffs and reinforced with wards of protection. They are the stronghold of the Sentinels of the Moon, the
            elite
            order of rangers and guardians who defend the kingdom’s borders. Here, training is rigorous and relentless:
            archers drill from high towers, bladesmen spar on stone terraces, and riders prepare for swift movement
            across
            mountain passes. Unlike the ceremonial guards of Erathel or the harmonious scouts of Levandell, the warriors
            of
            Arethon are hardened defenders, living with one purpose — to ensure that no enemy trespasses into elven
            lands.
