        <h1 class="text-center mt-3">Elven Armors – General Overview</h1>
        <p class="mt-5 border-bottom border-secondary pb-3 text-light" style="text-indent: 1em;">Elven armors are not
            only instruments of war but also works of art, forged with elegance, balance, and deep respect for nature.
            Unlike the crude iron of orcs or the heavy steel of men, elven armor is crafted with rare alloys, enchanted
            woods, and shimmering runes, designed to be both protective and graceful. Each type of armor reflects a
            philosophy: speed, balance, resilience, or majesty. Together, they embody the elven principle that warfare
            must never break harmony, but rather defend it.
        </p>
        <h5 class="mt-5 text-light  fw-bold">
            Light Armor
        </h5>
        <p class="mt-5 border-bottom border-secondary pb-3 text-light" style="text-indent: 1em;">
            Worn by scouts, archers, and rangers, light armor is fashioned from supple leather, layered cloth, and
            enchanted bark. It is adorned with leaf-like patterns, designed for mobility and stealth in the forests.
            Light armor allows its bearer to move silently, blending into the natural world while offering basic
            protection. Those who wear it rely on speed and precision rather than brute strength.
        </p>
        <h5 class="mt-5 text-light  fw-bold">
            Medium Armor
        </h5>
        <p class="mt-5 border-bottom border-secondary pb-3 text-light" style="text-indent: 1em;">
            Balanced between protection and agility, medium armor combines reinforced leather with plates of enchanted
            metal. It is favored by warriors who serve as frontline skirmishers, needing both endurance and flexibility.
            Medium armor is practical, yet still elegantly crafted, bearing subtle runes that provide resilience without
            sacrificing grace.
        </p>
        <h5 class="mt-5 text-light  fw-bold">
            Heavy Armor
        </h5>
        <p class="mt-5 border-bottom border-secondary pb-3 text-light" style="text-indent: 1em;">
            Forged from shining elven steel and etched with runic wards, heavy armor is designed for guardians,
            shield-bearers, and those who defend the kingdom’s gates. It covers the entire body, offering maximum
            protection while still lighter than human plate mail thanks to elven craftsmanship. Heavy armor represents
            resilience, a wall of living defense that enemies struggle to break through.
        </p>
        <h5 class="mt-5 text-light  fw-bold">
            Royal Armor
        </h5>
        <p class="mt-5 border-bottom border-secondary pb-3 text-light" style="text-indent: 1em;">
